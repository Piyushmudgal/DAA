/*
Transform a string to another
Given two strings s1 and s2, develop an algorithm to print the positions 
of the symbols to be swapped to get s2 from s1 with a constraint that symbol 
in any position ‘p’ can be changed only once. 
For example, if s1 = ‘abcd’ and s2 = ‘cdab’ 
then two swaps are required so print 1 3, 2 4. 
If s1 = ‘abcd’ and s2 = ‘cdba’ then print ‘Not possible’ 
since the string cannot be transformed by just swapping symbols in a 
position only once.

Input Format

First line contains the first string, S1

Next line contains the second string, S2

Output Format

Print the positions to be swapped
